# Monostate Example
Monostate is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance.

## Usage examples
The Monostate pattern does not solve all of the problems that the singleton pattern has, but it does provide an interesting way to keep single data values, while still allowing your classes to have multiple instances. Monostate classes are also easier to inherit from and modify than their singleton counterparts, and can be swapped out for true instance classes without modifying any external code calling the class.
